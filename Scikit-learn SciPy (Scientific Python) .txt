Scikit-learn provides a good amount of supervised and unsupervised (provides unlabeled data that the algorithm tries to make sense of by extracting features and patterns on its own) learning algorithms through a consistent interface. this helps engineers, to build the model very easily in a consistent manner.

This stack that includes:

Pandas: Data structures and analysis

NumPy: Base n-dimensional array package

SciPy: Fundamental library for scientific computing

Matplotlib: Comprehensive 2D/3D plotting

IPython: Enhanced interactive console

Sympy: Symbolic mathematics
